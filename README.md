# nginx-basic-auth, user: user1, password: ok123456
Example of Basic Auth with NGINX

To run the basic-auth example of nginx do:

```zsh
https://github.com/serafss2/nginx-basic-auth
cd nginx-basic-auth
docker-compose up -d
```

Then to test the connection you can visit the deployed example application at [localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085),
the example password is `ok123456`. Don't ask me why.
